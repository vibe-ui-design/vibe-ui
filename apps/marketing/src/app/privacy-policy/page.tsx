            stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the
            United States and other countries. If you are accessing our Service
            from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or other regions with laws
            governing data collection and use, please note that your Personal
            Data will be transferred to and stored in the United States as
            necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and
            Personal Data may be transmitted to our service providers supporting

            from the laws in effect in the country in which you are located.
            Where we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA or the United
            Kingdom we will take steps designed to ensure that your Personal
            Data receives an adequate level of security protection where it is
            processed and that your rights continue to be protected.
